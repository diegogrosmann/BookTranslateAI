## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0 Highlights

This is the first stable release of BookTranslateAI, representing a complete rewrite and internationalization of the codebase. Key improvements include:

1. **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling, logging, and recovery mechanisms
2. **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle books of any size with parallel processing
3. **Professional Documentation**: Complete English documentation with examples and API reference
4. **Extensive Testing**: Full test suite ensuring reliability and stability
5. **Multi-Provider Support**: Seamless integration with all major AI translation services

### Migration from Pre-1.0

If upgrading from a pre-1.0 version:
- All configuration files need to be updated for English interface
- Progress files are not compatible and will need to be reset
- API usage patterns have been standardized and may require code changes

### Known Issues

- Large PDF files (>100MB) may require additional memory configuration
- Some EPUB files with complex formatting may have minor text extraction issues
- Rate limiting with certain AI providers may require adjustment based on your API limits

### Future Roadmap

- **v1.1.0**: Additional file format support (DOCX, TXT)
- **v1.2.0**: Web interface for easier management
- **v2.0.0**: Custom AI model integration and fine-tuning support
